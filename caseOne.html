    <p><strong>Problem: </strong>The lack of other reliable means of contact between the school and its students, other from the instructors, is one of the main challenges in spreading the word about the event Focal Point. In the lack of a single online hub it is challenging to reach a large audience and guarantee that students are informed of major events and possibilities.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p><strong>Insights: </strong>During the research phase, it became clear that email behaves as an additional method for students to get school information. Many students check their school emails on a frequent basis to get announcements, updates, and reminders from teachers and campus organizations. This demonstrates the value of using email as a communication method to reach out to students with vital event information.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution: </strong> To address the problem of limited communication and capitalize on the existing reliance on email, the solution is to establish a newsletter tailored to the event Focal Point. This newsletter can serve as a dedicated communication channel to inform students about the event, showcase the work of participating students, and emphasize important event information, such as the date, time, and location.</p>
