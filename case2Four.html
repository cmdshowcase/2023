    <p><strong>Problem: </strong>There is a growing demand for a dedicated platform where designers can freely host their portfolios. Additionally, the accessibility of class activities and projects online is limited, which means missed opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

  <p><strong>Insights: </strong>In order to capture and share the invaluable experiences of students, we are embarking on a digital documentation initiative. By delving into the stories behind the scenes, we aim to provide valuable insights and perspectives for future students. To facilitate this process and ensure accessibility for years to come, we will develop a dedicated website.

The website will serve as a platform to showcase authentic narratives, personal anecdotes, and practical advice from students who have undergone various challenges and triumphs throughout their academic journey. By highlighting their unique perspectives, we can offer a comprehensive understanding of the student experience and provide valuable guidance to future cohorts.
