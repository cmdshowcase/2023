    <p><strong>Problem: </strong> The lack of event advertising has resulted in a significant number of students being uninformed about the details of the student showcase. This lack of awareness poses a potential risk to the eventâ€™s success, as students may not know when, where, or what the event entails, leading to lower turnout and engagement.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p><strong>Insights: </strong> As students primarily spend their time on campus, attending classes and engaging in academic activities, it becomes essential to reach them within this environment to effectively communicate information.</p>

      <p>This was another initial prototype I had before deciding on the poster cubes to place around campus. I wanted to create an interactive experience for students on campus but this used too many resources and had other difficulties such as lighting, height of the box for students, etc. </p></small></div>

    <p><strong>Solution: </strong> Introducing campus signage as a solution will address the issue of limited event awareness. By strategically placing eye-catching signage in high traffic areas on campus, we can capture the attention of students and provide them with the necessary details about the showcase and programs offered at SMC. Regular exposure to these signs will reinforce the event information, ensuring that students are consistently reminded and informed. This approach aims to increase awareness, generate interest, and ultimately drive higher attendance at the student design showcase. </p>
