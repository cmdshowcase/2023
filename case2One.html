    <p><strong>Problem: </strong>SMC is a school with a great design program, but it is not promoted and community-like as much as its main campus. The CMD does not utilize social media, emails, or printed advertisements as much as it could be, therefore, a lot of students don’t know much about CMD events, like the student showcase. Overall, this semester project’s challenge was to gain insight and set the foundation of what is needed to create a successful “user experience” for the student showcase. My specific challenge for this project was thinking about making a good and memorable impression for the audience to experience and want to come back to in the future. My research and interviews show that a lot of students don’t know about the student showcase because it is not promoted or talked about in class or around the other campuses. Since the showcase has not happened for years, staff and faculty are learning on the job as much as students. The overall event layout, budget, and promotion were stalled as there were not a lot of known details which created a chain of needing to get answers from another person. Another pain point was the community that is not felt around the CMD campus. As a community college, people may feel like they don’t need to make friends or be involved, but to make a memorable college experience for them, CMD can promote the many events they have and allow students to network and have fun during their time here.

  <p><strong>Insights: </strong> Throughout the semester, we were able to meet with the stakeholder, hold student interviews, and talk with other involved CMD campus individuals to gain insight and information, which helped with understanding the client’s needs on a deeper level, as well as ideate solutions for an efficient experience. The insight I gained for my project, the welcome booth, helped me learn about what kind of information people would like to be given upon entering an event, what kind of activities would draw attention, and the kind of interactivity people would be interested in doing like a photo booth.</p>

      <p>Other than the welcome booth layout and mapping, I documented and organized a spreadsheet of all the materials needed. It was organized by part of the booth, area surrounding the main table, what will be at the table, the photo booth, and more. In this spreadsheet I made detailed notes about either dimensions, its purpose, its location, and any questions I had. This served to be useful as I started to prepare for the event by gathering posters, prizes, backdrops, and other essentials.</p></small></div>

    <p><strong>Solution: </strong>The solution I came up with for the welcome booth was inspired by a small-scale launch party I did for a class back at CSUF in 2022. To spark excitement within the audience, I came up with a layout that incorporates free, fun prizes, music, table games, photo opportunities, as well as receiving information about the event. The welcome booth solution will deliver a memorable time for participants of all ages and for once, create the sense of greater community that CMD is looking for.</p>
