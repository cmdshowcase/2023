    <p><strong>Problem: </strong>The problem is lack of awareness...of the student showcase.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p><strong>Insights: </strong>In addition to advertising the event, showing off the CMD, and showing off what will be there, relating to others is something we found to be quite worth investing in, especially to fulfill the purpose goal of our video, which is to get people to come to the event, through increasing the awareness of the event in others. Relating to others was an important insight as well as time management, planning, and organization. And compassion understanding can be useful in business especially. </p>

    <p><strong>Solution: </strong> We made the video, but had to do takes more than once because of minor mistakes or new ideas. We just kind of did what felt right and it lead us to a successful video I think. LISTENING to feelings and ACTING on the ones that felt good, led us to success. Along with a lot of guidance from Luke and other classmates too in critiques. Teamwork, action, and a HINT a DROP of silliness to lightening things and add a sprinkle of enjoyment to the hard work we did. </p>
