    <p><strong>Problem: </strong> The main problems with creating a map for the Center for Design and Media Student Showcase were that there was no previous map of the campus that was not an architectural drawing or individual building. All the current maps of  buildings do not show the overall campus and where the buildings are on the campus. They are also created using the architectural drawings that have too much detail including beams and structural items that users don’t need. Other issues I discovered were lack of labels for entrances, restrooms,  parking, etc. A lack of color to differentiate the class types from one another.</p>

  <p><strong>Insights: </strong> Through primary research I found that there are four key things to consider in creating an effective and user-friendly map.</p>
<br>1. Purpose and Audience: Define the map's purpose and tailor it to the intended audience.<br>
<br>2. Content and Information: Determine what information is necessary and prioritize it accordingly.<br>
<br>3. Design and Visual Hierarchy: Create a visually appealing and balanced map with clear differentiation between elements.<br>
<br>4. Accuracy and Scale: Ensure the map accurately represents the real-world geography and use an appropriate scale.<br>
<br><p>Through secondary research I found out that the first prototype I created was not meeting the users requirements and was in the wrong style. I tried to create a 3D map that was great looking but didn’t meet the wayfinding needs of the user at the event and a more simple approach was needed.. The second prototype was more on par with the requirements needed for the user and the event.</p>

    <p><strong>Solution: </strong>The solution was to create a map using everything that was available and simplify it for the user. Key items needed to be highlighted and pointed out. Starting aerial images from Google Earth I found the locations of the buildings and got an overall view of the campus. I took the individual architectural drawings of each building and overlaid them on the aerial map. Then I redrew the campus and building map in Adobe Illustrator with the key requirements for the user and the event. Many prototypes were created and with feedback from my peers, fellow students, my teacher and stakeholders the final map design was achieved.</p>
